## Overview

This application offers an intuitive interface to explore and understand fundamental portfolio optimization theories used in quantitative finance. Each theory is presented with:

- Clear descriptions and context
- Step-by-step implementation guides
- Mathematical equations rendered with LaTeX
- Professional, readable formatting

## Portfolio Theories Covered

1. **Markowitz Mean-Variance Optimization** - Modern Portfolio Theory focusing on maximizing returns for a given risk level
2. **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)** - Relationship between systematic risk and expected return
3. **Black-Litterman Model** - Combines market equilibrium with investor views
4. **Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT)** - Multi-factor model for asset pricing
5. **Risk Parity** - Equal risk contribution from each asset
6. **Minimum Variance Portfolio** - Achieving the lowest possible portfolio volatility
7. **Maximum Sharpe Ratio Portfolio** - Maximizing risk-adjusted returns
8. **Mean-CVaR Optimization** - Minimizing tail risk using Conditional Value at Risk
